# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle, 
# created a table to insert Spotify data into, 
# and performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First, I wanted to display the average popularity, danceability, energy, and loudness of each artist.

SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy),
AVG(loudness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Next, I wanted to know the top 10 artists based on their popularity.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Additionally, I displayed the top 10 longest songs.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Finally, I created a CTE to calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table.
#Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a â€œTop Star"
#I displayed their name with their average popularity, and labeled each as a "Top Star".

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, 
average_popularity,
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
